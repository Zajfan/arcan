# A12

A12 is a remote network protocol for interactive, realtime multimedia
applications closely modelled on the needs of the local display server API used
by the Arcan project. It has extensions for supporting confidentiality,
integrity, discovery and adaptive compression. This document provides an
informal introduction for implementing and using the protocol and document its
security considerations, jalong with an overview of the existing tools and
support libraries that exist to leverage it today.
